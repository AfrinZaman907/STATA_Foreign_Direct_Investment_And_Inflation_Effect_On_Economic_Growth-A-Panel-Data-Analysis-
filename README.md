# STATA_Foreign_Direct_Investment_And_Inflation_Effect_On_Economic_Growth-A-Panel-Data-Analysis-
# ABSTRACT 
Economic growth is one of the important issues for a country which reflect the overall condition 
of a country. This study is based on the effect of foreign direct investment(FDI) and inflation 
on economic growth(GDP) and find whether they are co-integrated or not i.e. whether one 
country has an effect on another country. Also FDI follow economic growth by trade openness 
which cause the entry of foreign company. Using a panel data set 6 countries of 3 developed 
and 3 developing country over the period 2000-2019 as well as the methodology of dynamic 
panel with unit root and co-integration tests that show results shows that there is statistically 
significant relationship between them. 
# Introduction
The paper is organized as follows- Section 2 describes the research problem of the study; 
Section 3 focuses on the relevance of doing this particular study; Section 4 reviews literature 
in details; Section 5 deals with the research gap and proposes the research objectives; Section 
6 and 7 explains the data source and methodology respectively; Section 8 explains empirical 
analysis and finally Section 8 concludes the paper. 
# Research problem
This study examines GDP growth from 2000-2019, focusing on how FDI and inflation influence it. Unit root and co-integration tests are conducted to understand the behavior of developed and developing countries. The analysis highlights the significant impact of FDI and inflation on GDP growth, aiming to determine if the relationship is positive or negative and if the variables are co-integrated.
# Relevance of the problem
The study emphasizes the significance of understanding the relationship between FDI, inflation, and GDP growth. FDI plays a crucial role in economic growth, with its inflows accelerating since the 1980s due to globalization. The interaction between FDI, inflation, and GDP growth is important as high inflation rates can deter FDI inflows and slow economic growth. Additionally, FDI brings advanced technology that enhances growth, while inflation can reduce social welfare and efficiency. This study focuses on six countries, analyzing how FDI and inflation impact their GDP growth, particularly in the context of openness and globalization trends since the mid-1980s.
# Empirical Findings 
The main attention of this paper was to see the relationship between FDI, inflation and 
economic growth, and to examine the relationship between them with the help of STATA 
software. This section contains the panel results and interpretation of the results. It entails the 
application of statistical techniques to provide the basis for the testing of the research 
hypotheses.

This study analyzes the relationship between FDI, inflation, and GDP growth, focusing on developed and developing countries from 2000-2019. It employs panel data analysis, including OLS regression and dynamic panel models, to understand the impact of FDI and inflation on GDP growth. Results indicate that FDI positively affects GDP growth, while inflation negatively affects it. The study also identifies co-integration between FDI, inflation, and GDP growth, highlighting their interconnectedness in driving economic performance. Additionally, tests for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation reveal their presence in the data. Finally, the study identifies five break points in the series, indicating significant changes over time.

# CONCLUSION 
This study underscores the significant roles of FDI and inflation in driving economic growth. FDI serves as a vital source of capital, fostering job creation, technology transfer, and overall economic development. Conversely, high inflation rates hinder economic growth by increasing living costs and eroding purchasing power. The study utilizes advanced techniques and panel data analysis to explore the relationship between FDI, inflation, and GDP growth, revealing their co-integration. It emphasizes the importance of macroeconomic stability, trade openness, and infrastructure in attracting FDI. Overall, the findings highlight the intertwined nature of FDI, inflation, and economic growth, with implications for policymakers and investors.
